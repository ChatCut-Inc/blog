# Your AI Assistant Editing FAQ

Interested in how AI can speed up your editing process? Below are some common questions we get:

### 1. Can AI really replace a human editor?

Not exactly. AI excels at tasks like transcribing, identifying filler words, or grouping similar interview segments. But it still relies on human creativity for story flow, pacing, and emotional impact.

### 2. Will my media be used to train AI models?

No. We respect your privacy and maintain strict usage policies so your proprietary footage and transcripts remain secure and confidential.

### 3. How much time can AI editing save me?

It depends on the scale of your project, but many users report saving 30-50% of their usual editing time in the rough cut stage alone.
