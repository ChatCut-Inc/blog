# Why Documentaries Edit on Transcripts First
## Sort out the logic on paper to save time in the edit suite

Documentary editing often starts with transcripts because it's easier to visualize the story flow without getting distracted by visuals. By reading through the spoken words, you can quickly identify key moments, themes, and potential gaps in your narrative.

## The Paper Edit Technique

The paper edit approach involves:

- **Highlighting** important quotes you want to feature prominently
- **Cutting** tangents or off-topic sections early, so you don't waste time editing them later
- **Reordering** segments quickly before you commit to a time-consuming video edit

It's a classic practice in documentary filmmaking that helps organize the story logicallyâ€”saving you hours in the editing bay.

Sorting out the logic on paper can make the actual video editing much more efficient. You'll enter the edit suite with a clear vision for your story, allowing you to focus on polishing the visuals rather than constantly rearranging the structure.
