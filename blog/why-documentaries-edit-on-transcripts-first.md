# Why Documentaries Edit on Transcripts First

Documentary editing often starts with transcripts because it's easier to visualize the story flow without getting distracted by visuals. By reading through the spoken words, you can quickly identify key moments, themes, and potential gaps in your narrative.

## The Paper Edit Technique

- **Highlight** quotes you want to feature prominently.  
- **Cut** tangents or off-topic sections early, so you don't waste time editing them later.  
- **Reorder** segments quickly before you commit to a time-consuming video edit.

It's a classic practice in documentary filmmaking that helps organize the story logicallyâ€”saving you hours in the editing bay.
