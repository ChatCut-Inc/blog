# Paper Edit Workflow: Best Practices

If you’re working on an unscripted project—like a documentary, reality show, or podcast—paper editing (sometimes called a “radio edit”) can be a lifesaver. By focusing on the transcript first, you can:

1. **Define a rough structure** without getting lost in B-roll or sound design.
2. **Spot narrative weaknesses** before investing heavily in timeline edits.
3. **Collaborate easily** by sharing text edits with your team for quick feedback.

## Tools & Tips

- Use a cloud-based document for real-time collaboration.  
- Highlight “must-use” quotes in one color and “maybe” quotes in another.  
- Keep a notes column for quick references about desired visuals or any needed pickups.
